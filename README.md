# Database-Implementation
The final project of the COMS4112

Here, the implementaion of tree and probing methods may refer to the paper of Prof. Kenneth Ross.
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~orestis/sigmod14I.pdf

The three files denotess three methods of implementing the high efficiency probing algorithm.
The regular universal binary search, the non-hardcoded SIMD for all 5,9,17 trees , and the hardcoded SIMD for 9-5-9 tree.
In sequence the projec2a.c, project2b.c, project2c.c.
